CodeBook - tidy.mean.csv

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Variables

ID of the subject (30 subjects)
Activity label : Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
Mean and standard deviation of measurements from : Accelerometer (units : g), Gyroscope (units : radians/second)

Getting and cleaning data

The data should be already downloaded in a local directory. The data for the project is available at :

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script run_analysis.R does the following :

Get the data  and load to global environment
Build a data set for the Activities
Build a data set for the Measurements/ Features
Merge data  to create one dataset(Subjects, Activities and Measurements)    
Get the measurements for the mean and standard deviation  
Create an aggregate dataset (mean) 
Create final 2 csv files for means
Create txt file to upload

Additional package required : No

By merging the train and test data set, we get 10,299 rows and 563 variables (561 measurements, activity labels and subject identifier).

After extracting the mean and standard deviation of the measurements, the number of variable is reduce to 68 (33 means of measurements, 33 standard deviations of measurements, activity labels and subject identifier).

By aggregating by subject and activities, the final data set has 180 rows (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 68 variables.

Two files are produced :

tidy.csv : Data set with only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (10 299 rows by 563 variables).
tidy.mean.csv : Aggregate using mean for each activity and each subject (180 rows by 68 variables).
